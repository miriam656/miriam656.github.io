          <h1>About:</h1>
          <p>
            Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Miriam Solis M., a PhD student
            in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering at the University of
            Calgary with a focus on Pipeline Engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about the complex dynamics of fluid flow in pipelines
            and I'm dedicated to finding ways to optimize their performance and
            enhance their reliability.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this website, you'll find information about my research,
            publications, and experience, as well as some insights into the
            exciting world of pipeline engineering. Whether you're a fellow
            researcher, a student, or simply interested in the field, I hope you
            find this website informative and engaging. Thank you for visiting
            and for your interest in get to know me!
          </p>
